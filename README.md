# The State of This Project (As of July 26, 2024)
For about 2 years now, I haven't at all motivated to work on this project, and it will remain that way for some time. I don't want to label this work as 'abandoned,' but rather 'dormant' as that is more or less what it is. It's possible that I will come back to it some time later in life, but right now is just not the time. I just haven't had any interest in contributing towards it, and it feels pointless to continue right now. The pack has an OK quality upscaled UI, however [I believe there are more complete or better options elsewhere online by now](https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-mario-party-4-7-hd-ai-24-11-2022). The reasoning behind this is just how things are going in the real world (school and work), as well as the lack of connection to the game I've had. I didn't grow up with this game, so I lack passion towards the game, especially when compared to something like Mario Kart Wii, Super Mario Galaxy, and Super Mario Sunshine. I will also add that I've changed as a person (for the better, hopefully), and I'm really not a fan of using AI to upscale textures anymore. It lacks charm in my opinion, almost as if all emotion originally put into the texture was taken away. To claim that AI upscaled textures *always* look bad would be a lie, however. I have seen countless examples of it looking goodâ€”it's just not my thing at the end of the day. If anyone would like to continue where I left off for whatever reason, credit would be preferable, but is ultimately optional.

This is a Mario Party 7 texture upscale project in 4x resolution using mostly AI. Will make the whole game look a lot better in theory (obviously). I will upscale all textures with an AI, and then go back after to manually recreate a bunch after I finish to make them better.

# How to Install

To install this texture pack, you should grab the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/Najatski/mp7-hd/releases) and put it in your dolphin textures directory in `Documents/Dolphin Emulator/Load/Textures`. Put the `GP7E` folder in that Textures folder, and make sure to enable [`Load Custom Textures`](https://imgur.com/a/Vs4fj0J) in Dolphin.
