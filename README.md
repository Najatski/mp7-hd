# mp7-hd
This is a Mario Party 7 texture upscale project in 4x resolution using mostly AI. Will make the whole game look a lot better in theory (obviously).
 
# How to Install

To install this texture pack, you should grab the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/Najatski/mp7-hd/releases) and put it in your dolphin textures directory in `Documents/Dolphin Emulator/Load/Textures`. Put the `GP7E` folder in that Textures folder, and make sure to enable [`Load Custom Textures`](https://imgur.com/a/Vs4fj0J) in Dolphin.
